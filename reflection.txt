Based on this lab, I learned that branches are a powerful tool because they allow multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other’s work. Each person can create their own branch to add features, fix bugs, or test ideas while the main branch stays stable. This makes development safer because unfinished or broken code does not affect the working version of the project.

Branches also help prevent problems such as overwriting someone else’s changes, mixing incomplete features into the main code, and causing confusion when many people edit the same files. By using branches, teams can review changes before merging them, which improves organization and reduces mistakes. Overall, branching makes collaboration smoother, safer, and more controlled in team software development.
